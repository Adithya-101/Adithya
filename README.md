# Hey there! Adithya here

## 🚀 About Me

I'm someone who’s always been enthusiastic about **Computers, tech, and how things work under the hood**.

🔐 I just completed a **Beginner Cybersecurity Course**, where I explored :
- **Footprinting & Recon** (WHOIS, subdomain enum, metadata)
- **Network Scanning** (Nmap, Wireshark, OS detection)
- **Vulnerability Analysis** (Nikto)
- **System Hacking** (Metasploit, Responder, L0phtCrack, Steganography)

💻 Up next: I’m diving into the world of **Full-Stack Web Development** – aiming to build powerful, secure, and user-friendly web applications.
